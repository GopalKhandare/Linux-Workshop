Task 1
In this task you are asked to create a bash script called hungry.sh in your home directory.
hungry.sh should do two things:
Firstly, it should output the text I am hungry. Feed me data. to a file in your home directory
called demands.txt
Secondly, hungry.sh should also output the date and time that the demand was made to a file
in your home directory called demands.log
Do ensure that each output is appended to the previous one.
Hint: Ensure that the bash script starts with the required #!/bin/bash text
Task 2
Once you have created hungry.sh , you are tasked to edit your crontab and add a new row
so that hungry.sh runs every minute. Your computer loves data, after all ;)
